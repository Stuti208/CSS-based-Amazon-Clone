# CSS-based-Amazon-Clone

This project is a front-end exercise where I recreated the appearance of the Amazon website using HTML and CSS. Key features include a layout resembling Amazon's homepage, product listings with images and details and navigation menus. The goal was to practice CSS styling techniques and create a responsive, visually appealing clone of Amazon's interface.
